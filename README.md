# Bootstrap Grid Overlay

**Bootstrap Grid Overlay** is Simple Chrome extension which shows an overlay, with a Bootstrap's grid, inside the active/current tab.
You can choose what `container` to show, the total number of the columns, and the rest it's automatically styled by the Bootstrap's configuration of the current theme (such as **gutters**, mainly)

It uses [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store these customizations, now globally, _maybe one day per domain_.
